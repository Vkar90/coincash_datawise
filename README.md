# React Landing Page Development Task

## Objective

Develop a landing page based on the provided Figma design using React.

## Background

We're looking to evaluate your understanding of React, CSS, and best practices in web development. We'd like to see how you translate a design to a functional page, break down large views into reusable components, manage state, and style components effectively.

## Requirements

### Design Implementation

- Your React app should closely resemble the provided Figma design. Please pay attention to details such as spacing, sizes, colors, and fonts.
- For images and assets, export them from the Figma file or use placeholders where necessary.

### Component Breakdown

- Decompose the design into smaller, reusable components.
- Think about the hierarchy of components and how they can be reused in other parts of a larger application in the future.

### State Management

- Even if the landing page might be mostly static, consider a scenario where certain parts could be dynamic. Implement at least one piece of dynamic content that requires state management.
- For the purpose of this task, local state management (using React's `useState` or `useReducer` for instance) will suffice.

### Styling

- Use CSS (or CSS-in-JS if you prefer) to style your components. Avoid using UI libraries like Bootstrap or Material-UI for this task, as we're interested in assessing your raw styling abilities.
- Make sure your landing page is responsive. It should look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Code Quality

- Follow best practices in your code. Think about readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Comment on your decisions where necessary. If you decide to implement something in a certain way, or if you decide to skip something due to time constraints, let us know why.

## Bonus (Optional)

- Add smooth scrolling animations or transitions where applicable.
- Implement any interactivity you see in the design (e.g., hover effects, button clicks).

## Submission

- Push your code to a GitHub repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Design Fidelity:** How closely your implementation matches the Figma design.
- **Code Quality:** Cleanliness, maintainability, and structure of your code.
- **Component Architecture:** How you've broken down the design into reusable components.
- **Responsiveness:** How the landing page looks and functions on various screen sizes.
- **Interactivity & State Management:** Implementation of dynamic elements and state handling.

Good luck! We're excited to see your implementation.
