1. Typos in the design are corrected in the implementation

2. The vector in the hero image has position absolute in the design without it being part of the hero-content-container
but rather in the hero-container. This translates into the vector spanning full width on larger than 1440px screens which the design uses. Is this the implied behaviour?
