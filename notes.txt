1. Typos in the design are corrected in the implementation

2. The vector in the hero image and the background of circles are to be treated as a single image?
on mobile devices the design shows that the iphone vector is smaller. The currently implementation is that the iphone vector is the same size as the background of circles and resizes responsively. I can change this if needed.

3. mobile menu is not given on the design but is implemented, crosscheck with the design team on this.

4. active states are not given on the design but are implemented, crosscheck with the design team on this.

5. on textbox components mobile label and text sizes are not given. I have used the mobile equivalents but crosscheck with the design team on this.
